   <shortDescription>
      Allows execution of a Python script in a local Python
      installation.
   </shortDescription>

   <fullDescription>
      <intro>
         This node allows custom creation of a (Python compatible)
         deep
         learning network in a local Python installation
         via a
         user-defined
         script.
         The path to the Python executable has to be
         configured in
         Preferences → KNIME → Python.
      </intro>
      <tab name="Script">
         <option name="Editor">
            The script in the editor panel in the center will be
            executed to
            generate this node's output.
            "Execute script" will
            execute the full
            script while "Execute
            selected lines"
            will
            only execute the currently
            selected part of the
            script.
            <br />
            <br />
            The editor optionally provides autocompletion (CTRL + Space)
            if the
            Python module
            <b>jedi</b>
            is installed.
         </option>
         <option name="Flow variables">
            The pane on the left side of the editor
            panel
            lists the available flow variables. A
            double click on a
            flow variable
            will insert the corresponding identifier at the
            current
            cursor
            position in the editor panel.
         </option>
         <option name="Workspace">
            The pane on the right side of the editor
            panel
            is the workspace and lists the currently defined
            identifiers in the
            running Python instance. "Reset workspace"
            will remove the
            output of
            all past script executions.
         </option>
         <option name="Console">
            The console under the editor panel displays
            standard output, standard
            error, or other information.
         </option>

      <tab name="Options">
         <option name="Row limit (dialog)">
            Unused in this node.
         </option>
         <option name="Use python version">
            Allows to choose the python version that
            should be used for
            executing the kernel. Available
            installations can be checked
            under Preferences → KNIME →
            Python.
         </option>
         <option name="Missing values (Int, Long)">
            By default, Int and Long columns containing
            missing values are
            converted to doubles in Python, because
            doubles
            are the
            only numeric type
            containing a built-in missing
            value
            representation (NaN). Converting longs to doubles,
            however,
            introduces imprecision. The
            conversion may be
            avoided
            by replacing
            missing values with so-called sentinel values.
            To convert missing
            values to
            sentinel values before script
            execution, check the first
            option, to convert sentinel values
            back to missing values after
            script execution, check the
            second option. To select a sentinel
            value, click on
            MIN_VAL
            (the smallest possible value for the
            column's
            data type),
            MAX_VAL (the largest possible
            value for the column's data
            type), or a manually enter an integer in the text field.
         </option>
         <option name="Rows per chunk">
            Large tables are broken into chunks when
            they are transferred between
            Python and Java. This option
            controls how many rows are
            included in
            each chunk. The default
            value is intended for tables containing few
            columns having
            numeric types. If larger data types like
            images or text
            are
            transferred, a single chunk may exceed the
            maximum allowed
            buffer size. In this case lowering the value of this
            parameter helps getting reasonably sized chunks.

      <tab name="Templates">
         <option name="Create from editor...">
            Clicking on this button creates a new template based on the
            script in the editor panel of
            the script tab.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: User defined templates can be found in the folder:
            <i>knime-workspace/.metadata/knime/sourcecode-templates/dl-python-creator</i>
         </option>
         <option name="Remove selected">
            Clicking on this button removes the selected template.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: Templates provided by plugins cannot be removed.

         <option name="Apply selected">
            Replaces the script in the editor panel of
            the script tab with the selected template.
